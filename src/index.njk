    <h2>Illustrative and Visually Distinct Websites</h2>

    <p>
      For businesses that want more than a standard template look, illustrative and custom visual websites are available. Original vector graphics, scene-based layouts, and branded visual elements can be integrated directly into the design.
    </p>

    <p>
      These custom visuals are built to support the message of the page — not distract from it — so the website remains clear, fast, and search-friendly while still being memorable.

    <h2>Modern Website Development with Clean Structure</h2>

    <p>
      Sites are built with modern responsive layout methods, semantic HTML structure, and organized content sections. Clean structure makes pages easier for users to read and easier for search engines and AI systems to interpret.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on project needs, builds may use WordPress or lightweight modern site frameworks that prioritize performance and clarity.
