    <h2>Design-Driven Development, Not Page Builders Alone</h2>

    <p>
      While page builders and themes are useful tools, strong websites depend on underlying structure, content clarity, and technical decisions. Each project is approached as a build system — not just a layout — with attention to markup quality, section logic, and long-term scalability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The combination of development discipline and original visual design allows projects to be both technically solid and visually distinctive.
