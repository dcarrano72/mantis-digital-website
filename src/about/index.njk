      <h2>About Dave Carrano</h2>

      <p>
        Mantis Digital Media was founded by Dave Carrano, an artist and web developer who has been combining visual design and website development for many years. His background in illustration and digital design informs the way websites are structured and presented — with attention to clarity, visual hierarchy, and communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        That blend of art and development helps projects stay both clean and practical, while still leaving room for a more distinctive visual style when a brand calls for it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      <h2>What That Means for Your Website</h2>

      <p>
        Some sites are intentionally simple and streamlined. Others include custom illustration and more expressive visual elements. Either way, the goal is the same: clear messaging, strong structure, and a site that supports real business outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Website decisions are made around what will help customers understand your services quickly and take the next step.

[ONE COLUMN] SECTION 3 — PRACTICAL APPROACH
========================= -->
<section class="section-one-column">
  <div class="section-inner-container">

    <h2>A Practical Approach to Business Websites</h2>

    <p>
      A business website should do a few things well: clearly explain services, build trust, and guide visitors to take the next step. That comes from page structure, headings, section flow, and calls-to-action — not just surface styling.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each site is organized so content is easy to scan, easy to understand, and easy to expand later with additional service pages, location pages, and SEO content.

[ONE COLUMN] SECTION 4 — CUSTOM / ILLUSTRATED WEBSITES
========================= -->
<section class="section-one-column">
  <div class="section-inner-container">

    <h2>Custom and Illustrated Websites</h2>

    <p>
      In addition to standard business website builds, custom and illustrated websites are available. Original vector graphics, branded visuals, and scene-based illustrations can be integrated directly into a layout when a business wants a more distinctive look.
    </p>

    <p>
      These visuals are used with purpose — to support the message and brand — while keeping the site fast and readable.

[ONE COLUMN] SECTION 5 — TECHNOLOGY / BUILD APPROACH
========================= -->
<section class="section-one-column">
  <div class="section-inner-container">

    <h2>Technology and Build Approach</h2>

    <p>
      Websites are built using modern responsive layout techniques and clean front-end code. Many projects use a lightweight stack based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast, high-performance websites with minimal overhead.
    </p>

    <p>
      WordPress is also available when a project benefits from built-in content management, blogging, or extended features. The platform choice depends on what best supports the site’s goals, update needs, and long-term growth.
